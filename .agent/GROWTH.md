# FEREX Growth & Product Strategy

## 📊 Product-Market Fit Analysis

### Does It Fit the Need?

**YES - with gaps.** Federal employees have a HUGE pain point:
- OPM retirement estimates are confusing and come late in career
- HR gives generic advice
- Commercial financial planners charge $2k+ for federal-specific planning
- Federal retirement is uniquely complex (FERS/CSRS/MRA/Supplement/TSP/FEHB)

**Your app solves:** The early planning problem. People can model scenarios 5-10 years before retirement.

**Missing critical pieces:**
1. **FEHB (health insurance)** - Massive gap. "Can I keep my health insurance?" is #1 question
2. **Social Security coordination** - FERS Supplement, WEP/GPO for CSRS
3. **Special coverage groups** - Law enforcement (6c), firefighters retire at 50
